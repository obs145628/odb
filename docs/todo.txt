- Make sure OC8 works correcly with ODB

- Update OC8 README, use odb version from extern dir, and push to master

- create generic vm

- create and test generic llvm-like iR

- create and test generic ARM GBA-like

# Optimizations

- replace sleep by signal method on data-client-handler

- use async method instead of threads on data-client-handler

- when get_regs / set_regs / read_mem / write_mem used on DBClient,
  check if all variable size are the same, to make the special call with static size.

- cache all possible requests with DBClient


# Code design

- make all requests object on request.hh use the in / out field name convention

- change location of VMApi::Error (maybe put it where all other vm info types are defined)
