# Server Side (Emulator / VM)

## Execution Flow

1) When starting the VM, create instance of `ServerApp`, that requires:
   - many informations about the VM (eg nb regs, mem size)
   - settings to tell how the debugger can be controller externally
     (eg TCP, Websockets, port ? stdin ?)
     these are also set using env variables
   This call may block if the setting that requires to wait for a client before start is set.

2) When running, in the main loop, right before executing an intruction,
   call `next_ins` on ServerApp, giving some other infos about current state (eg pc location)
   The program will enter the DebuguerLoop, and will not quit it until ready for next ins.
   The DebuguerLoop may block (that's how breakpoints / step by step execution is working).

3) Once the program finished, call `terminate` on ServerApp, with some dtails such as
   PC of ins was caused stop, if it was a crash or normal exit.
   The program will enter the DebuguerLoop, and will not quit it until client is disconnected.


## ServerApp

Master class that controls everything server-side.

DebuguerLoop (call to next_ins / terminate)
     This loop keep running as long as the debugger is in stopped state,
     and the client is connected
     (breakpoint reached, step by step exec, program finished)
     It calls `run_command` that communicates with the client to get a command
     to give to the Debugguer. A `command` is simply a function call to the Debuguer API.
     `run_command` block until it gets a command from the client, or the client is disconnected.

     The first time the DebuguerLoop is entered, the VM is ready
     but no instruction has been executed yet. A call to Debugguer.on_init() is called.
     On all other entries to Debuguer Loop, an instruction just get executed, and
     `Debugger.on_update()` is called.

     The Execution can either block at the beginning, without executing a single instruction,
     to wait for a client, or instead run usually, and pause execution as soon as a client
     get connected.
     

## Debugger

The class that implements all of the debugging logics.
Receive `commands` through basic method calls (eg: get_reg, read_mem)
Also tell if the program should exec next intruction or wait for a command to tell it to do so.
With `ODB_SERVER_DB_LOG` defined, it writes to `./odb_server_db.logs`
every step that happened with the VM and the debugguer.
Really useful to find bugs

## ClientHandler

His simple role is to wait for a client to connect, read commands from input,
parse and use Debugger API, then send back result to client.
Generic interface.
Many implem for different client types: TCP, Websockets, Pipe, stdin



## VMApi

Abstract class, to query and edit VM state.
Need to be implemented for a VM to work with ODB.
This class it what makes possible to have a generic debugguer for any kind of VM.
